##This project is about implementing file handling operations in the C programming language as a part of my internship task at CodTech. The goal of the program is to create, write, read and append data to a text file using basic file operations provided by standard C library. File handling is a very important concept in any programming language because most applications need to work with files in some way, like saving data, loading configuration, reading logs or storing user info, etc. So this program basically helps in understanding how to use functions like fopen, fclose, fprintf, fgets and fputs in a real-world scenario. I wrote a small menu-driven program which asks the user to choose between writing to a file, reading from it, or appending more data. It also shows simple input and output operations which are very common in programming. When the user selects the write option, it will create the file if it doesn’t exist and overwrite it if it already exists. In append option, it will keep the old data and just add new lines to it. Read option will simply open the file and print its contents line by line. The program runs in a loop so that multiple operations can be done without restarting it. It’s pretty simple but also useful for understanding the basics.The program I made can be useful in many small applications or real life situations. For example, you can use it in a note-taking app to save text entered by user. Or it can be used in a logging system that keeps track of some process and appends messages or errors into a log file. You can also use the same logic in student records or simple local databases where storing data in text format is enough. File handling like this is also used behind the scenes in settings files, report generation and saving the history of user actions. I think this program is applicable to beginners who want to learn how file handling works in C, and how data can be persistent (not lost when program closes). Though this version is basic and doesn't do error-checking deeply or handling large files, but it's good as a start. Also I noticed that I initially forgot to add getchar() after scanf() and the input was getting skipped, so I added it later to fix that. There might still be some things I could improve like adding confirmation before overwriting file, or displaying message if file is empty, but I wanted to keep it simple.Overall I learned a lot about file pointers and how data flows between a program and the file system. This project helped me practice using conditionals, loops, and strings also, apart from file operations. I realised how even simple C programs can be powerful when they interact with files. This project was very practical and gave me confidence to build bigger C applications. I hope this meets the requirement of CodTech's file handling deliverable and shows that I have learned and implemented the concept properly.
